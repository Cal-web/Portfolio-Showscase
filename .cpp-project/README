***********Welcome to the repository for our Vehicle Attendance System App! *****************


This application leverages RFID sensors, NodeMCU, and a combination of C++, PHP, HTML, and
 CSS to provide a robust solution for attendance tracking system.

This Attendance System App aims to streamline the process of recording attendance of vehicles
 in the intention of monitoring and keeping of vehicle movements within a particular place. 
 By utilizing RFID sensors and NodeMCU, we have created a reliable and efficient system that 
allows users to easily manage attendance records.


The core functionality of the app revolves around RFID technology, which enables quick and 
accurate identification of individuals. When a user swipes/passes their RFID card or tag 
mounted on the car, the system captures the unique identifier associated with it. 
This information is then processed by the NodeMCU, which communicates with the backend using 
the C++ programming language.

On the web development side, i have employed a combination of PHP, HTML, and CSS to create 
an intuitive and user-friendly interface for administrators and users. The web application provides
comprehensive features for managing attendance data, generating reports, and monitoring attendance trends.
